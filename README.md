### Installation

#### requriments

   But AutoPilot will peformance appx 7 ~ 15FPS in FHD. \
   which is not enough to feel smooth

### how to install

currently i am supporting 'one-click-install' for windows.

1. download the file and open it( AutoPilot.exe )
2. it will automatically install the requriments. \
   this could take more than an hour.

3. Enjoy!
